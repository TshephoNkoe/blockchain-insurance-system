Blockchain Insurance System 🔗📑
A decentralized insurance platform combining Ethereum smart contracts with modern web technologies to automate policy management, enhance transparency, and prevent insurance fraud.

🌟 Overview
This system reimagines traditional insurance processes using blockchain technology to create trustless interactions between insurers and policyholders. By leveraging smart contracts for core operations and Vue.js for an intuitive interface, it provides:

Immutable Policy Records: All contracts permanently stored on blockchain

Instant Claims Settlement: Automated via predefined smart contract conditions

Fraud Prevention: Cryptographic proof of claims through IoT/oracle integration

Global Accessibility: Borderless insurance products with crypto payments

## 🔑 Core Features
1. Smart Contract Engine (/contracts)
PolicyFactory.sol:

Create parametric insurance products (e.g., flight delay, crop insurance)

Dynamic premium calculation based on risk parameters

ClaimsProcessor.sol:

Automatic validation using Chainlink oracles for external data

Multi-sig approval for high-value claims

TokenizedPayouts.sol:

ERC-20 stablecoin integration for instant settlements

Escrow management for premium pools

2. Frontend Dashboard (/front-end)
Policy Marketplace:

Filter insurance products by category/risk

Historical performance analytics

Claims Portal:

Document upload with IPFS hashing

Real-time claim status tracking

Wallet Integration:

MetaMask/WalletConnect support

Cross-chain compatibility (Binance Smart Chain, Polygon)

3. Backend Service (/back-end)
Risk Assessment API:

Machine learning models for premium pricing

Integration with external data sources (weather APIs, flight stats)

Compliance Module:

KYC/AML verification through third-party providers

Automated regulatory reporting

Notification System:

Email/SMS alerts for policy renewals

Webhook support for enterprise users
